# JavaHomework

This program is similar to the topics and count program from class however I have altered it to store student names and student ids. It uses a scanner to ask the user for inputs for names and ids and stores each one to their own arraylist. Afterwards it will pair up the students name and id and display them next to each other using a HashMap.
